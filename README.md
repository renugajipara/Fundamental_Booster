🚀 Interactive Personal Data Collector
A Beginner-Friendly Python Fundamentals Project



📌 Project Overview

The Interactive Personal Data Collector is a Python console-based application designed to demonstrate foundational programming concepts including:

User Input Handling

Data Types & Type Casting

Memory Management Concepts

Object Identity (id())

Date & Time Handling (datetime)

Clean Output Formatting

This project was developed as part of foundational Python training to strengthen understanding of core programming principles.

🎯 Objective

To build a structured and interactive program that:

✔ Collects user data
✔ Displays data types dynamically
✔ Shows memory addresses of variables
✔ Calculates approximate birth year
✔ Demonstrates understanding of Python object handling

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
Concept	Implementation
Data Types	str, int, float
Type Checking	type()
Object Identity	id()
Date Handling	datetime.now()
String Formatting	f-strings
Type Casting	int(), float()
